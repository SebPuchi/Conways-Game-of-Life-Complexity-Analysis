# Research Project
Complexity theory is an enormous field, and computability theory even bigger. There is no way to cover all of the topics in three semesters, let alone one. The purpose of this project is to make up for that, by allowing you to pick your own direction to go in and then giving you some room to do that. You'll be picking a topic of interest to you, learning that area of the theory yourself, and writing a report on it. I've given a list of topics below, but you are not required to choose one of them if you have an idea of your own. However, if you choose a topic which isn't one of the options I've given here, you'll need to bring it by me and tell me about it, to have it approved.
# Expectations and Guidelines
- Your write-up should be a minimum of 4 pages (single spaced, written in LaTeX). There is no maximum. Rather than putting everything in an `enumerate` environment like the homework templates I've been giving you, you'll want to make use of sections for organization and proof environments for definitions and proofs.
- You may work alone or in pairs (no more than two in a group, although I won't stop two pairs from picking the same topic).  
- Your project should include the stating of formal definitions and the proving of  formal theoretical results. It doesn't necessarily have to be the emphasis of your paper (I would prefer it to be, but research projects like this need to develop in unexpected ways), but there does need to be something. 
- While I am allowing you to work in pairs, that is with reluctance. The purpose of this project is to give you some room to pursue the acquisition of theoretical knowledge on your own, in a minimally restricted way. This tends to be a very solitary and personalized act. Even if you work with a partner, the two of you should both be doing some research independently. 
- You should show me that you are making connections between your topic and the theory we've been developing in our class, and/or connections with your existing understanding of computer science.
- A template file for the write-up is included in this repo, which is filled in with information of how to structure a paper written in latex (e.g. how to make sections, subsections, state and prove theorems in the appropriate environments, referencing and citations. Failure to submit a report based on the template will result in an immediate 15 points off of your grade.

# Presentations
- If you want to give a presentation on your project (or a piece of it), we will reserve a class day for this purpose. Presentation length will depend on sign-ups and available time. You likely won't have enough time to give a full proof of any results you've obtained. More likely, you will need to condense what you've learned into something which can be presented in a simplified conceptual way, similar to what I did with our recap class after the break ended. 
- You can sign up to present at any time prior to April 21 (yes, you can decide after the exam). Thus, you don't need to decide right away. For those presenting, the presentation will be 10% of their grade, assignments will remain 40% of the grade, proposal 5%, project 30%, and the exam 15%. For those who do not present, the grade breakdown will change slightly. 40% of the grade will be assignments, proposal 7%, exam 18%, and project 35%. Thus the midterm percentage has been slightly reduced for everyone. I've tried to adjust the grades so that presentation sign ups are a function of the *desire to actually do the presentation*, as opposed to fear of/reaction to bombing the exam. 
- If you do not choose to present, but someone else chooses to present the same topic that you are researching, the presenter will be alerted to who you are, and encouraged to approach you for input in presenting your topic.
# Timeline
- Tuesday, March 18th: Deadline to submit your project proposal. This proposal counts as it's own assignment, and will be 5% of your grade. (This portion will be removed from the In-Class Assignments/Quizzes grade on the midterm, since I haven't really been doing either.) Submissions by March 21 are also acceptable. 
- Tuesday, March 25th: By this time, you will see a 0, 0.5, or 1 on Canvas as the grade an assignment relating to the proposal (see that section of the instructions for details of what these numbers mean). 
- Thursday, April 3rd: If your proposal grade is still not a 1, it becomes a 0 permanently.
- Tuesday, April 21: Final deadline for presentation sign-ups.
- (Nominal) Thursday, May 1st: Presentation Day. (April 29 is also possible as reserve time, depending on sign-ups.) We may reverse these two days in order to have a final wrap up class where I can close things out. Not sure yet. 
- Friday, May 2: Final submission deadline. For those presenting, this remains the due date, **but there should still be a rough-draft pdf being available on the github repo that I can look at prior to your presentation.** 
# Project Proposal
- Your project proposal should briefly, in a short paragraph, outline the following:
	- What topic are you studying?
	- What are your goals regarding your topic? What are you planning to try to understand, what specific definitions, results, proofs etc are you planning on studying? These goals *are non-binding*. Independent research is a winding, tangled road which will often lead you in directions you don't anticipate. But it helps to have some initial goals regardless.
	- What are your sources going to be? What papers and/or textbooks do you have lined up for reading on your topic? These choices for your sources, by the way, are also *non-binding*. I just want to make sure that you've picked out a starting point by this time.
	- Are you working alone, or with someone else? If so, who? (Only one of you needs to accept the repo and submit their work.)
- Explaining the grade you will see on Canvas: A 0 means you didn't submit anything. A 1 means that your project has been approved. A 0.5 means that either your plan needs to be altered in some way, or that I think there is something which needs to be discussed regarding your proposal before I can fully approve of it. **A 0.5 does not mean that there is necessarily something wrong.** It could be that I think you need different sources, or that I want to warn you about something. 
- If you see this as your grade, **it is your responsibility** to approach me to initiate that discussion (either during my office hours or by appointment). I would strongly prefer this happen in person, and not via email, but I understand if this is not an option given your schedule. 
- If we have not had this discussion by the end of April 3rd, I will change your 0.5 to a 0, and that will be your grade for the assignment.
